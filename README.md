# Password Generator
This password generator asks user for password parameters and generates a password based on those parameters. The user is asked to provide the number of characters in the password and whether or not they want lower case letters, upper case letters, special characters or numbers. If the user does not select any character types, the password defaults to lower case only. 

It is guaranteed to pass at least one character set from each character set selected. 

The generator is set to validate whether or not the user provided password length is a number between 8 and 128 and selected at least one character set. If not, the user will receive an error message. 

The user can use the copy and paste button to get the displayed password. This functionality is only confirmed in chrome and firefox.
